# Git Definitions

**Instructions: 

** Define each of the following Git concepts.

---

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a means to make changes(commits) to different branches of your project without affecting your main branch. It is useful because it allows you to experiment or explore different avenues while still maintaining a working/bug-free (hopefully) Master branch.  It also allows multiple people to be working on a project at once.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

I like to think of a branch as an alternate universe where a copy of your code exists and can live its own life until it is pulled and merged into the original universe (Master). You would use one to make different changes to the code base or allow other people to work on it at the same time, and you can individually pull changes into the master branch once they are tested/approved.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a change/update/fix to the project, and a good commit message is descriptive and specific without being extremely long.

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflict is when 2 branches being merged have made changes to the same part of a file and git needs to know which changes to take.
