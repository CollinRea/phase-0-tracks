### Linux (& Web Servers)

##### Key Principals

* Open Source
* Treat all users with respect
* Small is Beautiful
* Each Program does One thing well
* Linux assumes you know what you are doing, does not handhold

##### Virtual Private Server (VPS)

A VPS is a block of memory and processing power on a server setup as a virtual machine with a copy of an Operating system for the operator of the server to have full access as if it were a physical machine.

**Advantages**

* Cheaper to setup when you don't need the processing power of a full dedicated server.
* Privacy/Security since you don't share your operating system with anyone, there are no other websites on your server that could potentially access you files.
* Customization - you can have multiple servers running any operating system, and they are small and easy enough to setup that you can try new technologies without a huge commitment.
* Dedicated resources that are not shared with anyone as if you were on a shared server.

**Root User**

It is good practice to not run programs as the root user to allow for security in not allowing administrative access to those programs, and to run at a user-level and keep administrative access to a minimum or as needed. It also allows for better tracking of work on servers with multiple users.
