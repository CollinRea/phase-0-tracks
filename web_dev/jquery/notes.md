## JQuery! 

#### Plan of Action

* Review tutorial at http://jqfundamentals.com/
* Take time to test some of the skills I learn
  * 30 Minutes of reading and then try it out
  * Break after 1st hour to reflect and have a drink :)
* Watch a few youtube tutorials to see it in action to get another perspective

#### By now I should have enough knowledge to move on to make a project!

##### I found the jqfundamentals.com website to be a pretty good resource, and I think I'll continue to use this to learn more.
##### There are also quite a number of really good tutorials on youtube where you can see others use jquery and see it in action, I enjoy learning this way however you can spend many hours watching videos, you can't forget to go practice it yourself.
