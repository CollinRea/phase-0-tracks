## JQuery! 

#### Plan of Action

* Review tutorial at http://jqfundamentals.com/
* Take time to test some of the skills I learn
  * 30 Minutes of reading and then try it out
  * Break after 1st hour to reflect and have a drink :)
* Watch a few youtube tutorials to see it in action to get another perspective

#### By now I should have enough knowledge to move on to make a project!
